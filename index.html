											<h3>Why pick Camden Market?</h3>
											<p><strong>Don't Tumble Darling</strong>, was first thought up during me and Simon's 2nd year of University during a 'deep dicussion' about our guaranteed joint future. Our love for London was truly something to consider while we were deciding where to locate, and the <strong>quirkiness</strong> and <strong>artsy side</strong> to Camden was 
												practically impossible to avoid. The diversity of the area along with other draw-in aspects to the area is more than likely to help encourage new customers. <br />
												A sense of community is something Simon and I take pride in, the need for comfort and happiness an essential aspect to the creation of our quote-on-quote <strong>Hipster Laundromat</strong>. Camden is also full of both students and young adults just like us!
											We are however, well aware of the competition we will be facing due to this location, the market having lots of good food options (not as good as ours mind) along with the other 'trendy' bars and clubs who also have live music. 
										This has motivated us even further to ensure our customers have the <strong>best experience</strong> they can while with us.</p>

												{Our collective journey}</a></h2>
											</header>
											<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3>It was hard work but we made it</h3>
											<p>First, we both had to think of what our desired customer would want to eat, as well as 
												something that we would enjoy cooking. This lead to quite a few different options, many of
												which that were unfeasible as a start-up business. One of the things that we felt most passionate 
												about was the menu being accessable to all, therefore we made the decision to make the majority of 
												the food menu vegitarian. The inclusion of meat options within both the panini selection and one of
												the burgers, being enough to satisfy those who do not want so much green. One of my favourite things
												on the 'Day Menu' being the "All Day Garden Breakfast" as well as Simon's favourite being the "Halloumi Burger". 
											</p>
											<p>The cocktail menu on the other hand, was a different story. We needed to stand out. We all know the 
												classics but we felt that we needed to add a twist to make us stand out. This resulted in th creation of
												our unique and themed cocktail names, everyones favourites reimagined to perfectly fit both the Don't Tumble Darling's vibe
												and what it has to offer to its loyal customers. The inclusion of cocktails to our menu was simply to create a new
												and modern atmostphere to the humble laundromat, one that we hope the customer wont have felt before (plus who doesn't love a cheeky drink?)
